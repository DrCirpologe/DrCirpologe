# 👋 Hi, I’m Oguzhan!

As a Junior App Developer, I am passionate about creating modern cross-platform applications using Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP). Since January 2025, I have been participating in the Advanced Experts Program, where I have been deepening my knowledge and focusing intensively on cross-platform development.

💡 I particularly enjoy designing robust and scalable software architectures and connecting shared business logic with intuitive user interfaces on Android (Jetpack Compose) and iOS (SwiftUI). I build on a solid technical foundation and practical experience with KMP, Ktor, Koin, Coroutines, and Firebase (Firestore & Authentication).

✨ I learn quickly, enjoy exploring new topics, and thrive on collaborating with teams to develop effective solutions. My goal is to build apps that are not only reliable and performant but also highly user-friendly.
